00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.350
What if I told you that most of your
beliefs about money aren't true what

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.470
have you been learning the rules of
checkers when you really need to be

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.010
learning chess
well like chess life is a game and those

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.420
who don't know how to play are destined
to fail but those who master the game

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.740
money will be able to realize well it's
at an early age and live a life more

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.350
enjoyable than any video game could ever
simulate but here's a problem where do

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.400
you start to learn these pivotal money
skills as we already know school does

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.000
nothing to educate its students on
financial literacy or entrepreneurship

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.079
so we are limited to learning our money
beliefs from our parents or friends and

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.649
unless your family and friends have
built successful businesses and have

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.430
cultivated their own financial skills
then your chances of adopting the money

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.930
skills you'll need to become rich or low
putting it bluntly people who learn

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.500
their money skills from other poor
people are destined to live a life of

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.120
financial mediocrity on the flip side it
is not uncommon to see people who are

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.160
raised around wealth become wildly
successful because from a young age they

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.869
have had solid financial teachings
bestowed upon them as of 2019 it's

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.729
reported that 78% of Americans are
living paycheck to paycheck which means

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.780
that they likely have next to no assets
and are drowning in debt that's

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.740
basically four out of every five people
in the United States who are struggling

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.360
financially and when you add in another
10 or 15 percent of Americans we're

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.290
living up best in the middle class it
leaves just a minut amount of people

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.360
truly living a wealthy lifestyle now we
all probably have different definitions

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.530
of being wealthy but my definition is
when you have enough money that you

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.759
never have to work again while
maintaining a lifestyle you enjoy and as

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.409
a statistic show very few people are
wealthy so why are so many people

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.369
struggling here's the problem
growing up the majority of us are given

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.060
the set of instructions that will
provide us a stable life well the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.290
details can vary these instructions
typically are as follows graduate high

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.340
school go to college
find a nine-to-five job work for 40

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.479
years and then hope you have enough
money saved to retire what the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.379
instructions fail to point out is how
hard it will be to pay off all that

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.370
college debt how agonizing those 40
years were

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.870
we'll be if you have a bad boss and how
even with strict saving you may not have

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.099
enough money at sixty-five to retire the
sad reality is that the standard

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.690
blueprint is followed by so many people
leading them into a life barely getting

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.250
by which is why millions of Americans
are living paycheck to paycheck now I

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.390
don't know about you but I want more for
my life than just getting by which leads

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.590
as to why these set of instructions have
led us astray if you took a look at

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.150
those instructions a little bit more
closely you would see an asterisks and a

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.620
set of fine print out of the bottom of
the page this fine print would say by

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.980
following these instructions you are
trading in your opportunity for wealth

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.200
and immense success for a life of
predictable income and security now I

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.500
know you clicked on this video because
you wanted to learn how to become rich

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.030
in an early age and I can understand why
it's a lot more fun to drive around

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.200
under your Ferrari in your 20s then when
you're 80 and have to struggle to get in

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.940
your car but the first thing I will tell
you is that there is no secret they'll

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.750
make you wealthy overnight understand
that when you see gurus on YouTube

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.959
telling you that you can make twenty
thousand dollars a month in your first

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.819
month of dropshipping save yourself the
time and move on to the next video the

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.459
truth is you already possess within you
what you need to become rich you possess

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.730
exactly what companies like Apple and
Amazon have used to become

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.410
billion-dollar businesses what you have
inside you is more than enough to allow

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.609
you to earn as much as you want and live
the lifestyle you could only dream of

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:49.250
but the issue is very few people harness
this power this power exists in the

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.720
power of ideas Amazon started with the
idea of selling books online and is now

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.120
one of the biggest companies on the
planet

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.109
sadly no where in your instruction
manual do you see the advice to come up

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.430
with ideas and pursue them endlessly
this is why to become rich while you're

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.989
young you will have to throw away those
instructions and blaze your own path

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.930
well this may disappoint some people in
your life you know that those

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.400
instructions didn't lead anyone else who
follow them to financial success so why

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.539
would they work any better for you
Einstein once said insanity is doing the

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.010
same thing over and over and expecting
different results if your parents or

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.810
friends were poor because they followed
the state

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.580
lifestyle then by you following this
same path you too will be destined for

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.690
financial struggles no boss maybe
strange to listen to a guy I making

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.100
animated videos on YouTube when it comes
to deciding how to formulate your whole

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.930
life and quite frankly I expect you to
be skeptical up until now you have

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.889
probably been following this defined
path but the status quo isn't always the

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:53.000
best option and it certainly isn't if
you want to become rich at an early age

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.320
if you do find yourself following this
set of instructions just know that for

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.419
almost all of my life I was too both my
parents graduated high school went to

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.310
college and then got jobs following the
instructions to a tee and when I was

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.270
born they passed along those same
instructions to me for one thing I can

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.190
tell you is that following this plan
didn't allow them or myself to live a

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.330
wealthy lifestyle always having to make
frugal decisions despite putting in

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.560
countless hours at work each and every
week but the difference between my

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.280
parents generation and ours is that
technology has now made these

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.419
instructions obsolete people are
harnessing the power of the Internet to

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:38.060
work less make more and realize all of
their financial aspirations this is why

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.990
affiliate marketers are making tens of
thousands of dollars a month and white

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.850
oil reviewers on YouTube are making a
million or more dollars a year none of

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.840
these people are following the typical
mold yet they are seeing a hundred times

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.919
the financial results of those who have
bought into the archaic model of living

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:59.030
so if you want to become rich at a young
age begin to look around at other young

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.570
people who are living the lifestyle you
want to live and see how they are

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.530
earning their income chances are they
have thrown out their instruction manual

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.520
and have pursued ideas that wall against
the norm have yielded them immense

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.490
success it's now time for you to leave
your old path behind and blaze a new one

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.250
thanks for watching if you want to go
from the life you have to the life you

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.800
